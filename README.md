# inkscape_HersheyText

Yet another HersheyText fork of a fork.

There are multiple "Hershey Text" extensions floating around GitHub. The one bundled with inkscape seems to be deprecated by evil-mad, evil-mad's version v3.0 [is missing some EMS fonts.](https://github.com/evil-mad/EggBot/tree/master/inkscape_driver)

This is what I use, if it's helpful for you have at it.
